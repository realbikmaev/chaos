i just spent inordinate amount of time (3 hours to be precise) just to setup python on my m1 machine this shit is clearly ridiculous. 

1. create new dotfile repo add shit to manage:
    - pyenv
    - poetry
    - docker
    - rust
    - go
    - node
    - julia
    - vs code
    - devcontainers
2. scripts to manage 'em both on linux and mac
3. handy fn:
    - pip freeze > ./requirements.txt
4. decode what to do with omz and zsh
